# Crypto Currency Clustering using K-Means and PCA

This project aims to cluster cryptocurrency data using the K-Means algorithm and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the data and potentially predict future price movements.

## Visualization

The composite plot generated from the original cluster analysis results and the PCA-reduced data cluster analysis results is used to visualize the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data.

The plot shows that the PCA-reduced data has more compact clusters, with more data points falling within cluster 0 and cluster 1 compared to the original dataset. This suggests that using fewer features to cluster the data can lead to more interpretable clusters.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using K-Means clustering and PCA for analyzing cryptocurrency data. The results indicate that using fewer features to cluster the data can lead to more interpretable clusters, although this reduction in dimensionality may also lead to some loss of information.
